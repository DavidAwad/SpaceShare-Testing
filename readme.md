So there are a lot of different kinds of testing you can do with things like JUnit and Grunt if you have seen [this]() repo with some cool stuff you can add to the javascript on your webpages. 




If you are planning on working on this and you get an undescriptive error like `uncaughtError: SyntaxError: Parse error`; this can be particularly infuriating, so I highly reccomend that you try something more robust to find your error. 

Try instead of running it the normal way with `casperjs test.js` 

use `node test.js` node is MUCH better at telling you what happened.
